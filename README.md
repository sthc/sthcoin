Sthcoin
=======

Sthcoin is based on Bitcoin, yet has a few critical improvements including (but not limited to) the following:

* A security loophole is fixed. With the loophole, some Bitcoin addresses are guaranteed to lose coins.
* Only CPU mining is possible. Thanks to our unique DOWS (Dynamic Operations with Wide Sampling) algorithm, GPU/ASIC mining is either inefficient or cost-ineffective.

In addition, Sthcoin is an **open project**. Everybody, tech-savvy or not, can contribute and earn coins in one or more of the following ways.

* Mining
* Referral
* Lottery
* Development
* Helping Q&A
* Management
